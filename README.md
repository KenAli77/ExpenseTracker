- [Room](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room?hl=en) - SQLite object mapping library.
- [DataStore](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/datastore?hl=en) -  DataStore uses Kotlin coroutines and Flow to store data asynchronously, consistently, and transactionally.
- [Jetpack Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) - Navigation library to ensure consistent and predictable user experience.
